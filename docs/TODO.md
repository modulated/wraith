# Todo

## Arrays

-   Struct field assignment (obj.field = value)
-   Multi-dimensional arrays (arr[i][j] = value)
-   Runtime bounds checking (optional)
-   Array slice assignment (arr[1..3] = [a, b, c])
-   Compile time bounds checking

## BCD

-   Peephole optimization to combine SED/CLD for consecutive BCD ops
-   Compile-time BCD literal validation
-   BCD string conversion helpers

## Compiler warning

-   unused function warning
-   address location is overlapping with compiler code generation areas in config
